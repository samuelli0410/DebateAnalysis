 Looking forward to our thing in a few weeks. --> []
Yeah, I don't know if I'll end up being there, but I'm hoping to. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I'm hoping to. --> []
What do you guys have like a liberal cuddle party or what do you do? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Yeah, yeah. --> ['Slogans']
Larry takes a bunch of MDMA and we all sort of go into the corner and hang out together. --> []
God, that sounds incredible. --> ['Slogans']
Liberalism is wonderful, man. --> []
You should come try it. --> []
That's not liberalism. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
It's called something else. --> ['Doubt']
Sorry, Nikki, is our cryptos are joining us or no? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
He's, uh, I'm talking to now. --> []
Looks like he is. --> []
Oh, Zing, this is going to be great to be like ratings, bonanza. --> ['Slogans']
All right, we do have David Sacks here. --> []
David and she have a quick time on. --> []
Look at Sacksie, please. --> []
Look at the surprise, it's so presidential. --> []
He looks thin, doesn't he? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Oh, he looks fabulous. --> ['Slogans']
All right, here we go. --> ['Slogans', 'Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Three, two, one. --> ['Slogans']
You're like your winner's pride. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Rainman, David Sacksie. --> []
And I said we open sources to the fans and they've just got the reason. --> ['Doubt']
Love you, West. --> []
I'm Queen of King. --> []
I'm going back. --> []
All right, everybody, welcome back to the number one podcast in the world. --> ['Flag-Waving']
I'm your host, Jason Calacanis with my besties, Jamal Pauli Haapatia, our chairman, dictator, and live from well, the administration, Mr. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
David Sacks, our czar for AI and crypto. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
And amazingly, two fantastic guests this week. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
We have New York Times writer and host of the Ezra Klein podcast. --> []
It's got a new book with Derek Thompson abundance. --> []
Any co-founded Vox in 2014. --> []
And he's our guest here today before Trump ships him to El Salvador. --> []
Please welcome Ezra Klein, are you sir? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Glad to be here by final hours of freedom. --> []
Okay, great. --> ['Slogans']
It'll be here. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Sorry, Sacks. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
And with us, of course, Larry Summers, economist, former treasury secretary, under Clinton, former director of the National Economic Council, under Obama, and the president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006. --> []
Thanks for coming, Larry. --> []
It'll be with you. --> []
Okay, we have a lot to get to here. --> []
So we might as well talk about the big news of tariffs. --> []
It's day 80 of the Trump presidency. --> []
And a second presidency, his second term, and Trump tweeted that he paused tariffs for everyone but China on Wednesday. --> []
Basically, let me just queue up the details, Larry, and then we'll get your take on all of this. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Just one week after liberation day, Trump announced on-truth social that, in effect, he was raising tariffs against China 125% based on their lack of respect, quote unquote, instead of negotiating, and then he was pausing reciprocal tariffs on all other countries for 90 days. --> []
And markets ripped 10% after he posted this. --> ['Slogans']
And today, Thursday, when we tape, there's been a massive sell-off on Wall Street. --> ['Slogans']
So the roller coaster ride continues. --> []
What it will be on Friday when you consume this podcast is anyone's guest. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
S&P is down 5% today. --> ['Slogans']
For contacts, the S&P was at 5,700 pre-liberation day. --> []
So about a 9% drop after these wild swings. --> ['Slogans']
And in fact, this has been historic volatility. --> ['Slogans']
Here are the top sell-offs in history. --> ['Flag-Waving']
As you can see, three of them came during Black Monday in 1987. --> []
Three of them came during the financial crisis. --> []
Three of them came during COVID and coming in 11th is Trump's tariffs. --> []
Also, in the Gainers, you have these big rebounds. --> []
Wednesday's 9.5% recovery was number three. --> []
The administration says this was all part of a master plan. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
We'll hear more about that later. --> []
And that they laid a trap for China. --> ['Slogans']
They laid a trap. --> ['Slogans']
Bessent has been the spokesperson during this retreat or whatever we're going to call the pause. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
And quote, this was driven by the president's strategy. --> ['Doubt']
He and I had a long talk on Sunday. --> []
He was his strategy all along. --> ['Doubt']
I don't think we need to play the clip. --> []
That's the gist of it. --> []
The White House count then tweeted in all caps. --> ['Slogans']
My favorite way to tweet. --> []
Do not retaliate and you will be rewarded. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
Wall Street Journal, on the other side, posted a story about why Trump blinked. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
The Chronicle, the decision as being affected by Jamie Diamond, who went on Fox to express fears of recession while saying the tariffs were valid. --> []
And that he knew the Trump and Cabinet will be watching him on Fox. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
They're banking executives who felt they didn't have a lot of influence in this administration, according to the Wall Street Journal, started lobbying Republican lawmakers. --> []
That the Trump tariff plan would tank the economy, the White House chief of staff, who's who I started receiving calls from executives and lobbyists expressing concerns. --> ['Slogans']
And the Wall Street Journal reports that Trump was influenced heavily by Bessent. --> []
They were flooded with worried calls from Wall Street. --> ['Slogans']
And that the president was lobby to find an off ramp. --> []
Trump ultimately relied on his instincts, according to the administration. --> ['Doubt']
Larry, is this 4D chess? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Or is this something else? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
What are your thoughts? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
It's dangerous work with a sledgehammer on a pretty sensitive machine, which is the global economy that's having really serious consequences. --> ['Slogans']
First, it's important to understand that there's more tariffs that are around than you described. --> []
Even after the big back-off, there's a 10% across the board tower of a range of structural tariffs, like on steel and automobiles, and a range of new tariff threats, like on pharmaceuticals. --> []
Here's a kind of market-based estimate of what the damage that the market thinks this is all doing to the US economy is. --> ['Doubt']
Markets down, let's take today's number 9%. --> []
If that's right, that would be about $4 trillion. --> []
Of course, $4 trillion since liberation day, of course, markets were down coming into liberation day, because of some anticipation of these policies. --> []
Let's be conservative and say these policies have taken $6 trillion off the stock market. --> ['Doubt']
The stock market only measures the adverse impact on corporate profits, not the adverse impact on workers, not the adverse impact on consumers. --> ['Doubt']
You need to add to that stock market number. --> []
One way of thinking about adding to it would be to say that corporate profits were 10% of the economy, so you could argue for multiplying by a factor of 10, but maybe that's being too exaggerating or too bold. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
So let's multiply by a factor of 5. --> []
What you get is a loss in the $30 trillion range as the present value as estimated by markets of what's being done. --> []
Now, I know that Trump administration sometimes likes to say it's working for Main Street, not Wall Street. --> []
I noticed that they were pretty excited about the stock market rally yesterday in a way that wouldn't really go with, not caring about markets. --> ['Slogans']
So I think what markets are seeing is what's true, which is three things. --> ['Doubt']
This is an inflation shock, because you're adding to prices. --> ['Slogans']
The CEO of Amazon got it right. --> []
The Secretary of the Treasury got it wrong. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Increases in tariffs of this magnitude. --> []
The overwhelming part of them will be passed on to consumers. --> ['Slogans']
So you've got an inflation shock. --> ['Slogans']
When you raise the prices of people and their income, at least in a short run, is the same. --> []
They're poor, and that means they can afford less stuff, and that pushes the economy down. --> []
And so you've got higher inflation, and you've got more less demand, and therefore more unemployment. --> []
And all of that's bad for the economy and companies. --> []
And the last thing, which I think is profoundly important, is we are trading like an emerging market country right now. --> ['Flag-Waving']
For serious countries, for the United States, the pattern is that when the world gets riskier, the bonds go down in yield, and the currency goes up in value, because people come for the safe haven. --> []
When you're a country like Argentina, then the assets all move together. --> []
Falling stock prices go with higher bond yields, go with a weakening currency. --> []
And so because of our erratic behavior, we have changed the zeitgeist surrounding America, from the traditional zeitgeist surrounding America, to the kind of zeitgeist that surrounded Juan Perones, Argentina. --> ['Slogans']
And that goes with all the other things that are happening. --> []
The more protectionism, denying the independence of the central bank, fiscal irresponsibility, break down of traditional boundaries between government and business, substantial, cronism, as a strategy, authoritarian tendencies towards the opposition. --> ['Slogans']
Lack of total respect for judiciary. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Keep going, Eric. --> []
Keep going. --> []
What we're seeing is a pattern of America being governed on the kind of Juan Perones, Argentina model. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
And that sometimes produces some benefits for some people in the short run. --> []
That sometimes generates popularity for it, Perones kept coming back in Argentina, but ultimately it's extremely costly for a society. --> []
You've heard Larry's take on all of this. --> []
Larry's giving it about a B plus on the Harvard grade scale, which might be inflated. --> []
I'm not sure. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Sacs, obviously, in the administration, you cover two things, AI, and of course, crypto. --> []
And you're a member of the pod. --> []
So let's get your take on what happened this week with these tariffs, even the most ardent supporters of Trump have felt this is chaotic, not well executed, not communicated well. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
What's your take? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Sacs on how this was executed and could this have been done better? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Well, I think what happened if you go back to liberation day was only eight days ago is April 2nd. --> []
If I had told you on April 1st that Donald Trump would find a way to get the entire world to eagerly embrace a 10% tariff on the American market. --> []
And not only would they not complain, but they'd actually be relieved that it was only 10%. --> []
You would have said that would be an April Fool's joke. --> ['Slogans']
If I had told you eight days ago or nine days ago that Trump would find a way to accelerate the United States is decoupling from China, which is something he's long wanted to do. --> []
And that Wall Street would basically breathe a sigh of relief over that. --> []
You would have said that there's no way that could happen. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
If I had told you eight or nine days ago that President Trump figured out a way to assert a presidential power in a way that gives America extraordinary leverage over virtually every country in the world, you would have said why I don't believe it. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Causal Oversimplification']
I don't, you know, what is that power? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And he proceeded to do that. --> []
And now basically every country in the world except for China is coming to Washington seeking to negotiate a new trade deal for the United States on better terms for the US. --> ['Flag-Waving']
If you told me any of that few days ago, I would have believed you and I would have thought the consequences would be a substantially deteriorated American economy and a substantially less secure. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
I don't think we know that. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I don't think we know that. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
It's not any surprise. --> []
There's nothing surprising about the fact that the United States has the power to extort Lusano. --> ['Flag-Waving']
It's just and that's what's the country that was singled out in the Trump formula for the highest level of protection. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
There is no surprise in that there is no surprise. --> []
That's not going to Washington right now isolated. --> []
It will be very, very fast coming to Washington South Korea is coming to Washington. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
Everybody's going to try to cut it. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
Never would have occurred to anyone with experience in government that the United States would have any difficulty getting any major country to come send a representative to the United States to have a discussion and a negotiation with a United States on a matter that was of concern to the United States. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Causal Oversimplification']
Never could possibly have come as an example of sex reply to that and then Ezra I'm going to bring you in. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Sacks go ahead. --> []
You reply. --> []
Then why didn't they Larry? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Do you think that all these countries were going to renegotiate their trade deals with the US if President Trump asked nicely if he said pretty please renegotiate our trade deals so you take down your trade bears they would have done it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Appeal to Authority']
If he said pretty please re the cherry on top that's not the way these things work he had to establish the leverage in the negotiation first and the fact that matters is the first president in decades who's going to do that you don't get anywhere by disasking nicely and I think that what president Trump did over the last eight days is a establish the leverage and be get all these countries to now want to negotiate a new trade deal with the United States if this is such a terrific thing. --> ['Slogans']
Why do markets think it's so terrible for the American economy maybe there's maybe the markets just completely wrong but at least another possibility is the market judging this the market I mean job of markets is to look forward it's to look past the immediate it's to see what the long run consequence are going to be and markets are making a pretty devastating negative judge not true not true. --> ['Slogans']
That feels emotional and nice but it's just not accurate so let's just establish a couple facts about quote unquote the markets number one there are two markets and they behave totally differently and sometimes inversely to each other there's the stock market and there's the bond market with respect to the stock market what they are debating and you're right Larry is what is the effective long term rate of return. --> []
A dollar needs to generate in order to pay me back that dollar that is what the fundamental stock market does and what we've seen for many years with training balances trade deficits and close to zero interest rates of which more of that happened under Democrats and Republicans we have allowed the stock market to inflate past historical averages. --> []
What we've actually seen happen in the last week is what most people would call mean reversion the stock market is still way above where it was last year two years ago three years ago what has happened is that the forward multiples have compressed so that's number one that's a fact you can debate whether that's bad or good and I'm willing to debate that with you okay now let's go to bonds yeah and then with respect to bonds what we are seeing now is there are two very complicated issues and we don't know. --> []
What the unknown known is and let me be very specific in the last two days we saw one part of the bond market totally get out of that and what we know is that the yields changed materially in a very acute way which is a typical of how the bond market typically digest a philosophical change in approach to policy normally when you see an acute reaction in the bond market the underlying reason tends to be some financial calamity in a participant what we heard in the last 24 hours is a lot of this move may have been attributed to an enormous levered bet on US treasuries by a Japanese hedge fund it will take three and four and five and six weeks for us to really know separately what we do know though where the structural complexity of the market and this is where Larry I agree with you is acute and important to observe is in the credit markets for private companies and that is where you have to pay a lot of attention. --> ['Slogans']
Okay Larry let me let you respond to Chimath's response to you and then as I promise you're going to come next Larry go ahead. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
As you well know the vast majority of financial thinking emphasizes changes in the earnings prospects of companies associated with the strength of the economy as a major source of stock market fluctuations and if you look at dividend strips if you look at what's happening to analyst revisions that's got a lot to do negative prospects for the economy has a lot to do with the economy. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Why the stock market has turned down was the foreign exchange markets very big and it's a big referendum on whether people have confidence in the United States and somehow power of reduced imports are supposed to reduce dollar selling and make the currency go up and not only is the currency not going up it's going down substantially. --> []
So we're seeing a pattern maybe it's all just due to one Japanese hedge fund but maybe we're seeing that pattern three days that really looks that looks pretty much like the Argentine pattern as right you are hearing this debate I think there's no debate that this was done in a very extreme fashion at a minimum do you wonder if this could have been done in a more gradual or thoughtful way which are take on the end of the market. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I can't say I wonder if it could have been done in a more gradual or thoughtful way it could have I defer to Larry on the markets I'm more of a connoisseur of arguments and something I've been thinking about over the past very long eight days is covering the 2024 election and covering Donald Trump's tariff promises and it was a thing that liberals like me were doing where we do these shows and say Donald Trump is promising a 10% to 20% global tariff and then 65% tariff on China and if he does that it'll have this set of effects higher prices it'll create financial uncertainty etc. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
And what I would be told like the counter argument was oh you lips you always take him literally when you should be taking a serious ad but back from a Swami on my show he said he's not going to do that that's just a negotiating play and this was the common line from Trump allies on Wall Street. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
And then I watched his he's began doing not just that but layering a series of them bilateral tariffs on top of that plan. --> ['Slogans']
The markets began freaking out while they were freaking out a bunch of his defenders said no no no actually these tariffs which we told you were never going to happen or actually a great idea we need to reset the entire global financial system and you can ship those tectonic plates without creating a few earthquakes. --> ['Slogans']
Then the moment the tariffs paused the 90 day pause on the tariffs on top of the 10% and the China tariff then I heard nope that pauses genius having read the art of the deal. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
And what I would observe from this is it usually when an idea is good you don't need people jumping back and forth on it so often going between these tariffs are a bad idea but they're smart negotiating play to these tariffs plus or an actually great idea you should all calm down as Trump said you should all be cool back to know these tariffs are a great idea I think I'd love to hear from David it's very hard to break the pattern being a podcast test. --> []
I would like to hear what the measure of success in two years is right we can sit here and speculate about the effect of these and I'm much more on on Larry side the one I'm hearing from from from from from Chimouth and David but if what are your measures what in two years good question if manufacturing and so employment or whatever is below X will you be unhappy if GDP is what what is a sort of objective yardstick where we can come back in 700 days and say did this work out or was this a bad idea. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Good I would say probably the biggest thing would be whether the U.S. --> ['Flag-Waving']
can re-industrialize to some extent so that we're not completely dependent for our supply chains on an potentially hostile adversary and what is the measure that is it the quantity of manufacturing we're making is it the share of manufacturing is a hard thing to understand you know during COVID we learn very tight points I am saying it concisely during COVID we discovered that we were hardly dependent on a supply chain from China for sure. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
From China for some of our most essential products for pharmaceuticals for other medical gear that we needed during COVID so what would be if you were to put a metric on it as one example but we've also learned that our entire supply chain for all sorts of industrial products now is dependent on China and other countries so let's be more precise we have 4% unemployment. --> ['Flag-Waving']
At the record low of our lifetimes and do you think Americans want to work in these factories and if so which factories obviously pharmaceuticals that's a dependency obviously building ships and weapons that's a dependency I think we can all agree on that and that might be hundreds low hundreds of thousands of jobs do you believe we should be making Nike sneakers here do you believe we should be making jeans here again what what would be the objective measure of success like a certain number of jobs certain number of factories certain types of factors because the other piece that I don't understand and maybe you can inform me here sacks is number one who's going to do this work if we're going to be deporting millions of people and we have the lowest unemployment of our lifetimes and we have automation coming to these factories and Americans don't want to take these jobs historically how is this all going to work it seems a bit far so well to me that we're going to bring these things back I don't think the millions of Americans who lost their jobs in the heartland because we let China into the WTO which is something that we're going to do. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
Larry I think supported in champion. --> []
We're talking about decades ago right yeah that's what started this whole thing yeah okay I don't think those millions of people want to lose your job so you're talking nonsense what are you talking about there. --> ['Slogans']
Exactly David you're a treasury secretary. --> []
We won one day walk China to the WTO and you're just defending it. --> []
I was watching an interview. --> []
David Larry you just get in there with Neil for a minute. --> []
Why am I going to talk for two seconds before I get in a rough day you guys get five ten minutes finish your thoughts finish your thoughts for three minutes and then I will speak for two seconds then you know me you speak for five or ten minutes go right ahead Larry I just saw you do an interview with Neil Ferguson where he asked you was it a good idea to bring China to the WTO was it a good idea to give them permanent normal trade relation status basically MFM. --> []
Which is something that Bill Clinton did in 2000 and I met it was bipartisan George W. Bush continued it was in you were defending this as a good idea for the country what was the result of that over the past 25 years millions of industrial jobs were lost or export to China millions of factory shut down the United States has a diminished and a hollowed out industrial base we certainly can't make the products of the future like drones or semiconductors Jason just to answer your question. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
Yeah obviously I have a question I think you're going to do that. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Yeah obviously some industries are more strategic than others do I personally care about sneakers or textiles no I personally don't do I care about semiconductors absolutely do I care about circuit boards do I care about drones do I care about robots do I care about. --> []
Evie's and cars absolutely okay those stories we are no longer in a position David we are no longer in a position as a country to make those products I just we exported our entire supply. --> ['Flag-Waving']
I have three questions for you one can you name a single trade barrier that was reduced by the United States associated with China access a single restriction that existed in the United States that had not been in place for five years before that we removed during the United States. --> []
China's WTO accession can you name one I don't think we said done any of it Larry we open our hearts of Chinese goods what restriction your your thesis is that we through open the market and therefore we exposed ourselves to all of this China thing. --> []
And question I'm asking you is can you name any restriction on Chinese exports to the United States that was in effect in 1999 and was removed by our WTO accession in 2000 can you name any such restrictions just name one policy that built up over time it was basically made permanent hold on it was made permanent we walk China's the WTO and can you name it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I'm sorry I'm sorry David I'll ask the question one more time we had given them MFN status 15 years before no one they had MFN status they had it for 15 years there was not a single reduction in a barrier to Chinese trade so the way in which you're describing it is just bears no resemblance. --> []
What was the point of bringing them into the WTO was to use the leverage that we had to win a whole variety of concessions that enabled us to Larry let's move forward I want to respond to this you're doing history all right listen is a bad deal hold on a second I want to let's go back to this I just want to know the whole argument you are making is about increased exports to the United States that had bad consequences and so I'm just going to keep asking you. --> ['Slogans']
What barrier that previously existed. --> []
I'll name them I'll name them. --> []
Go ahead. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Let me get you one. --> []
Prior to the WTO China imposed a bunch of export duties and taxes on a whole bunch of goods to control of. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Okay that prioritized domestic supply as part of coming into the WTO China said hey hold on we'll limit these export duties to only a specific set of products. --> []
And then they cap those duties at agreed rates number two they eliminated export quotas they you historically had export quotas to manage the volume of goods. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
Under that WTO commitment they agreed to phase out all those quantitative restrictions on exports except were explicitly justified under WTO number three they removed the export licensing restrictions number four they ended state trading monopolies for exports number five they liberalize foreign trade rights the point is people thought that China was going to be a honey pot of economic activity. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
And it turned out to be a sucking sound a grand sucking sound of opportunity where the globalist corporation saw a massive labor arbitrage so it's fair to say that it was done with the best of intentions but it was a bad deal. --> ['Slogans']
I really want to say that rather than having 30 minutes of debate over something that happened the 90s I would I would like to go back to this question I keep not here. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I would answer your question because I was a great question. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
David but I'm I love yours to. --> []
I want to stay. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I'm going to just see to just be talking in an anecdotal way. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
I'm not in a show. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
We want to give me I would like to announce these policies and then there's never a trick. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
There's give me what indices you are going to look for where if it's if in four years it is under X I can come back and we can have a conversation. --> []
So there's a matrix. --> []
As Rob. --> []
Sorry. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
There's a matrix for you. --> []
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Let's go back to Bill Clinton speech that was given a Johns Hopkins on March 9th 2000. --> []
He was asking about forward David forward looking metrics. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
What would you think would be successful two years from now? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Not the history lesson. --> []
We haven't finished the debate about China and PNTR. --> []
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
But my question predated that debate. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
We're trying to get the sense that classes finish up on the stop. --> []
We're trying to move forward. --> []
That's all we're trying to stop on this topic. --> []
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
So March 9th 2000 Bill Clinton announces PNTR at Johns Hopkins. --> []
It's a very famous speech. --> ['Flag-Waving']
You can tell us about how I got written. --> []
Anyway, Bill Clinton promises several things. --> ['Straw Men']
He makes a number of arguments for PNTR. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
He does not think that this does nothing where your argument is that Bill Clinton didn't do anything. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You're saying that somehow it happened under Reagan or something like that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
That's not what Bill Clinton was arguing. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
He said number one, there'd be huge economic benefits for the U.S. --> ['Flag-Waving']
He says quote, by this agreement, we will increase exports of American products. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
He means to China. --> []
That will create American jobs. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
To that happen the way we intend it, I don't think so. --> ['Doubt']
Number two is he believed that when you looked at the data on export flows from the United States to China, it actually did happen at a quite substantial rate. --> ['Flag-Waving']
But with huge trade deficits in the United States. --> ['Slogans']
You're arguing that they did not act in a discriminatory way. --> ['Doubt']
Towards our products. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
This idea that Americans could just do business in China the way that they could do business here as ridiculous. --> ['Causal Oversimplification', 'Slogans']
Anyone who tried to do business over their nose, you had to create a JV. --> []
You had to get a local partner, give him 51%. --> []
It was extraordinarily difficult. --> ['Slogans']
We were discriminated against Larry. --> []
It was ridiculous to try and claim that somehow this was an equal relationship. --> ['Slogans']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
And we imported far more from them than we ever exported to them. --> ['Flag-Waving']
So Bill Clinton was wrong about that. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Number two, he said that signing PNTR and bringing in the data and bringing China to the WTO would promote democracy in China. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
That we would export one of democracy's most cherished values, economic freedom. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
Did that happen? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I don't think so. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
He said this would strengthen global trade by ensuring China adhere to international trade rules, reducing trade barriers and resolving disputes through WTO. --> []
Did that happen? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I don't think so. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And then he said on national security, he said it would improve our national security to bring China to WTO and help make them rich. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
He said, quote, if we don't deal with China in this way, we will increase the prospect that they will turn inward. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
That's not what happened. --> ['Doubt', 'Appeal to fear-prejudice']
We help make China rich. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
We've exported millions of jobs to them. --> []
They built up their economy and their supply chain to the point where now they are a global competitor to the United States. --> ['Flag-Waving']
They're a peer competitor. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
We turned that baby dragon into a grog on-sized monster that can now challenge us in Asia and across the world for primacy. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
Why in the world we have done that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Disrupt for national security reasons. --> []
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
So Larry, I guess I have to let you maybe self-grade. --> []
How did you guys do? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Is there any regrets as Saxas pointing out there? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Obviously China has not magically become a democracy, but I guess you could argue they do have a middle class now. --> ['Slogans']
We haven't gone to war with them. --> []
So I guess you could argue that this has been good for relations, but to Saxas point, they are incredibly powerful and they are our top adversary. --> ['Flag-Waving']
How would you grade the history of this so we can move forward? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I was a surging, growing, reforming economy, growing at double digit rates. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
That it was before there was any WTO agreement. --> ['Flag-Waving']
The WTO agreement did not change a single rule that represented a U.S. --> []
restriction on imports from China. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
It did change a variety of rules, not as far as I would have liked, that let the United States export more to China, and that protected the United States intellectual property in China, and that brought China more closely into the international system. --> []
You need a counterfactual for what would have happened if China had been excluded from the World Trade Organization. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
That counterfactual is not that they would not have sold goods to the United States. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
That principle had already been crossed 15 years before, not a single restriction was reduced. --> []
But look, anything you would have done differently is... I don't get the whole mindset here. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I understand that we should have done more as a country for the Rust Belt and invested in it much more heavily. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
If I was worried about dependence and strategic and all that, the last policy I would have wanted to abolish was the Chips Act. --> []
That's the largest boldest thing the United States has ever done to avoid dependence in a national security area. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Let me branch them off. --> []
The Trump administration has killed all of that. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
You heard as original question and the history here from Larry and David looking at their sum industries that we need strategically form a military cars. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
These are fairly obvious where earth minerals are obvious. --> []
But we also have the lowest unemployment of our lifetimes and Americans probably don't want to work in factories on mass. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
What is your take on going forward some metrics that this administration should not sacks of saying this, you're saying it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
What would you measure this success as in terms of ensuring and reducing dependencies? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
If to as was point two years from now we were degraded. --> []
Give us some specifics here, Trima. --> []
There is a major issue that the United States has that's much bigger than China, which can be framed in the lens of resiliency and the ability to defend for ourselves. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
There are supply chains that have many single points of failure and independent of whichever country that single point of failure exists. --> []
It could be an ally or it could be a foe or it could be a frenemy. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
That creates risk. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
And I think what we are learning and David's right it was really highlighted during covid we are not in a position to take care of what we need. --> []
I had to very precisely answer as well as question. --> ['Doubt']
I would say that we need to measure and protect for critical areas. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling', 'Causal Oversimplification']
Everything else I think we can deal with some inefficiency, some single points of failure, but the following four areas as I would say are sacrosanct. --> ['Slogans']
Number one is all of the technology, both the chips as well as the enabling technology around artificial intelligence. --> ['Flag-Waving']
It must be a robust, largely American supply chain. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
It must you cannot have single points of failure outside the United States because what you see is even in allied countries, their posture towards things like free speech and other things can ebb and flow, their posture on trade, their posture on defense. --> []
Number two is energy. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
We have a critical deficit of electrons in America. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
We do not have the capability we need to make the energy we need quickly in many ways. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
We have supply chain issues on that gas. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
We have critical supply chains that can be shut off by China around photovoltaics. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
So whether you believe in coal, whether you believe in that gas, whether you believe in clean energy, we are in a very bad. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
Sure. --> ['Slogans']
Number three are there are critical material inputs that drive the material science of the future. --> []
Rare earths are an example going back to chips, things like gallium, things like phosphorus even. --> ['Slogans']
So we have a critical minerals and rare earths and material science input problem. --> []
And then the fourth Ezra are pharma APIs so that when American citizens get sick, we have the ability to not just make it, but also design it and manufacture it because some of these APIs, the active principle ingredients for many of the drugs require very convoluted and complicated processes, coal chains and the like. --> []
And there we depend on folks whose view of the United States can change in real time. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
So if I had to say to you Ezra, what I would expect is if the United States government, whoever was in charge, would put those four things on a board, then detail out all of the key inputs, measure how much we can make ourselves versus import. --> []
And then basically try to level that playing field. --> []
We would be in a very good place. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
And then we would be in a very good place. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']

And then we would be in a very good place. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
And then we would be in a very good place. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
But none of these, you can't do all of these things at once. --> []
And it needs to be very stable. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
If you're going to get companies to do these long term CAPEX investment decisions that take decades to play out. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Nobody I know in the markets. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
If I didn't see you guys in want to change anything. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You guys in want to change anything. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I wasn't in the Biden administration number one. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I'm trading in Israel and Larry as a team. --> []
I would love to change things. --> []
I just want to make sure I would like to change all kinds of things. --> ['Doubt']
And then that would be the Democrats didn't want to change anything. --> ['Doubt']
Let's see if we can cause. --> []
Let's see if we can even emit that PNCR didn't eat anything. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
We will not keep doing PNTR for minutes. --> []
But let's look forward and not backwards. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
Look at the Chips Act, look at the IRA Act. --> []
They did the exact things we're talking about. --> ['Doubt']
Larry go ahead. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Let's see if we can find a little bit of agreement. --> []
Please hear. --> []
I agree with Jamal Sajjana. --> ['Loaded Language']
I mean, I may not agree in every detail. --> ['Loaded Language']
But I broadly agree with Jamal Sajjana. --> ['Loaded Language']
And I'll go a little further than that, Ezra. --> []
that, Ezra, I think Joe Biden's attachment to energy security was kind of selective. --> []
And heavily oriented to green technologies, not others. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I thought canceling the keystone pipeline was a clear mistake. --> []
I thought the stopping a variety of things involving liquid natural gas were a clear mistake. --> []
So I think the Biden administration's approach to regulation that empowered every NGO with respect to stopping transmission lines, with respect to constructing power plants because of the importance of democratic constituencies was a mistake. --> ['Doubt']
So I think energy security is a central objective of policy and that there's a lot of room to move beyond what the Biden administration did. --> []
I actually believe that very strongly and agree with Timoth and David. --> ['Loaded Language']
What I don't understand is tips absolutely right. --> ['Flag-Waving']
The chips act was all about making there be an American semiconductor industry with production in the United States. --> []
There's a central priority. --> []
The Trump administration has declared war on that. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
Rare Earths, we want to have a strategic petroleum reserve for any rare earth. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
You want to do more mining in the areas that Timoth says we should in the United States or in friendly countries. --> []
I am all for that. --> []
Here's what I cannot understand, Timoth. --> []
I don't see how your resilience agenda drives anywhere near liberation day and the emphasis on tariffs. --> []
It drives towards a set of specific industrial policies, perhaps including tariffs in some particular product areas, but steel from Canada. --> []
Anything from Lusoto, any natural resource product across the board tariffs on everything. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I think you are absolutely right about resilience and that traditional conventional economics has given it too little thought and that COVID pointed that up as a central issue. --> ['Flag-Waving']
But I can't understand is why Donald Trump's echoing of Leia Coco from the A's about tariffs is responsive to any of that. --> ['Slogans']
But this is the point I'm trying to draw around Biden. --> []
I'm not saying I agree with every way the Biden administration defined its objectives. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I just wrote an entire book about the failures of democratic policy making in this specific era. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
What I am saying is a Biden administration's view of trade with it. --> ['Doubt']
There are targeted industries. --> []
We should be putting a lot of both domestic policy and international policy into play in order to protect and restore or French or and the Trump administration's view is that you have a generalized problem running all across the world that requires highly general policies that then when I ask people to defend it, they sort of move to this targeted argument. --> []
Donald Trump's view, I feel like we end up making something that is not that complicated into something much more complex than it is. --> []
Since the 80s, Larry's point about Leia Coco, Donald Trump has appeared to hold the view that any time the U.S. --> []
is operating at a trade deficit with someone else, that is evidence we are being ripped off. --> ['Slogans']
That is how you get at least the initial set of tariffs here that work off of bilateral trade deficits and try to correct every single one with every single country, be it Lysoto or a collection of islands inhabited by penguins. --> []
I think it is really important to be connected to the policy that was actually announced and not sort of projecting all of our own onto it. --> []
Yes, Larry's right, that you could have a different set of critical industries than Biden did. --> []
The Biden team was very focused on clean energy over other kinds of energy. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I also do not agree with the liquid gas pause. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I thought there were some, and we did not do nearly enough on things like permitting reform. --> []
There is a lot you could have done that they didn't do. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
If what you have in your head is a targeted idea of resharing specific industries or near shoring or Frenchering or whatever, which is kind of what I am hearing from a number of people on this call, then it seems like you would want targeted policies. --> []
What we have is not targeted policies. --> []
It is broad-based policies. --> []
So, 90-day pause on larger broad-based policies and a huge trade war with China. --> ['Slogans']
I would like to hear a defense from somebody. --> []
I would like to say. --> []
As René agreed, specific policies, I would like somebody to explain to me why it is a remotely sensible theory to say that the United States is being exploited by any country where the overall pattern of trade is such that we are running a trade deficit. --> []
Maybe in the process, you could explain to me why my grocery store is exploiting me because I am running a massive trade deficit with that. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Trade deficit, Shemafer, Sachs, who wants to take it? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I can start the maybe Sachs and Sachs and so let me actually start by giving some credit to where Biden did do a few things, right, just in the spirit of finding some common ground. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Inside the IRA, I think that there were two things, and I have said this pretty repeatedly, but I just want to put it on the record again. --> []
The ITC credits and the ITC transfer markets for those credits, the tax equity markets, are critical industries in America to support private investment in all kinds of very complicated markets, energy markets being the most important. --> ['Flag-Waving']
What the Biden administration did to their credit was remove the uncertainty because those things had to be renewed over and over again and they gave us a very long window where we could underwrite investments to your point, Ezra. --> []
That was smart. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
But it's important to also remember that in order to get Biden's budget done, what they did was they had mentioned roll over on permitting reform. --> []
And Ezra, you know this probably better than all of us. --> ['Flag-Waving']
When you look inside of the CHIPS Act, as smart as that initial policy was, if you ask, why has nothing actually happened? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Why have no fabs actually been built other than grandiose statements? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
The answer is that, which you speak to in your book. --> []
It's just this complete malaise and inability to actually get these things permitted and turned on even when it's right. --> ['Slogans']
So I just want to acknowledge that that's there. --> ['Doubt']
So Larry, very, very importantly to your question, the thing that we have to acknowledge is that in certain countries, what you have is a very blurry line between private and public industry. --> ['Slogans']
And they have this very tight coupling. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And again, I hate to go back to China, but it is the best example of this. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Where what do they have? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I choose one other country just for the sake of it. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
We can use Korea, we can use Japan, we can use Germany, okay? --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
There are instances where the government balance sheets support private industry. --> []
They can support them in three different ways. --> []
Number one is tax credits that they can use, the subsidies that they can use to build the things that they need. --> []
Number two is how then they can support that in the active selling and engagement in public spot markets to shape the demand curve of the things that are made. --> []
And then number three is the taxation on the back end, the terms of repayment and the capital cycle. --> []
Those are things that in the United States, we overwhelmingly turn the responsibility over to the private markets to do. --> []
We are the cleanest, the purest form of capitalism in that sense. --> ['Flag-Waving']
But many other countries are shades of this. --> ['Straw Men']
And again, let's not talk about China, which is a thing. --> ['Straw Men']
So, I agree with you. --> []
So Larry, so what do you have is how do you defend dumping? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
How do you defend that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
How do you defend spot market manipulation that drives American companies out of business? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Causal Oversimplification']
How do you fight that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And I think here's the problem. --> []
If President Trump had announced a big broadening of anti-dumping law to confront a variety of instances of what he's what the administration after careful economic analysis saw as inappropriate subsidy. --> []
I might or might not have thought that they were doing that in the right way, but we wouldn't be having this argument. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
The front pages would not be about tariff policy day after day, and the stock market would not be down by $5 trillion. --> ['Slogans']
The central thing we are discussing is not whether there are sensible modifications to trade policy to respond to bad practices in other countries or to promote resilience. --> []
Those are technical debates that frankly aren't that interesting to a large number of people. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
The question is whether declaring that we need a whole new era of US economic policy around universal tariffs against everything is a rational step forward. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And what I would say, I got our trade surplus as a judge. --> []
Now we're talking about the Monte Carlo simulation of how to achieve the outcome. --> []
And what I am saying is there is just as much as you and I want to guess, the fundamental and honest answer is none of us know. --> []
The people in the White House, what they know, they will share a little bit at a time. --> []
Because the reality is if what you wanted was a white paper or if what you wanted was paint by numbers, I think back to David's point, all that would do is just take any leverage that they had and give people the opportunity to shape their response. --> ['Doubt']
And I think in traditional game theory, and again, in traditional game theory, I think the right thing to do is when you're playing poker, you play street by street. --> []
What's the flop? --> ['Slogans']
Make a set of actions. --> ['Doubt']
What's the turn? --> ['Slogans']
Make a set of actions. --> ['Doubt']
What's the river? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Make a set of actions. --> ['Doubt']
And I think if you're going to play to win, this is what they should do. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
Make their cards very, very close to the vest. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Realize that you can't necessarily surgically go and attack the Lithia market first, then the rare earth market second, because it all goes back to the same balance sheet. --> []
It's the same actor over and over. --> []
I think there's a useful analogy to draw here. --> []
I think a lot about an article Mark Daner wrote in the New York Review of Books many years ago about the Iraq War. --> []
And it's an article that is stuck in my mind forever. --> ['Flag-Waving']
What he says about it is that one of the difficulties of the politics of the Iraq War is there was no one war. --> []
There was everybody's private war that they were projecting on to the Bush administration. --> []
The liberal humanitarian vision of why we were going to war and what that war would look like. --> []
You had a realist vision for it. --> []
You had a vision that was more about weapons of mass destruction and keeping the whole land safe from terrorism. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling', 'Causal Oversimplification']
You had people believe there was an Iraq al-Qaeda connection. --> ['Doubt']
There were really dozens of these, which is how you got as broad a coalition behind as bad a policy as that together, because everybody said, you know, there being a little bit vague about what's really going on here and why we're really doing this. --> ['Slogans']
But I bet you, if you go into their heart of hearts, what they want is the thing I want. --> ['Doubt']
Even though the policy doesn't quite match what policy you would get from starting from my premises. --> []
And that's really what I hear here. --> ['Doubt']
I hear it on this show, but I hear it in general in the discussion around this that there are a lot of different objectives being projected onto Donald Trump and his trade war. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
The objectives do not fit the policies we're seeing. --> ['Doubt']
The objectives are not stably articulated by Donald Trump or the people around him, nor is any specific objective being articulated in a stable way without contradicting objectives, also being articulated at the same time. --> ['Doubt']
And look, maybe in the end, and this is why I want to push you all on metrics, you get something you like out of this. --> ['Doubt']
But you're giving away a lot of clarity just on the trust that what is happening is people are keeping a good hand of cards with a good strategy, a poker hidden from you. --> []
As opposed to what's happening is what we seem to be seeing in public, which is Donald Trump is a chaotic and erratic person. --> ['Slogans']
They are making policy in a chaotic and erratic way that policies having chaotic and erratic consequences. --> ['Slogans']
And then they are operating and moving on the fly in chaotic and erratic fashion. --> ['Slogans']
So actually heard Ezra say that he feels this administration is being a bit chaotic in the approach here. --> ['Slogans']
What's the counter to that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You heard Shaman say, hey, this is a really thoughtful. --> []
They're holding their cards close to the chest. --> []
Maybe you could clarify what your position is. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Is this too chaotic or is this crazy? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
I mean, hearing is a bunch of process objections to Trump's policy. --> []
And I'm hearing a bunch of nitpicking. --> ['Slogans']
What about the suit to or whatever? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
This is a very unrealistic view of politics when we've had a bipartisan consensus in Washington for decades that unfettered free trade is a good thing no matter how big our trade deficit got, no matter how rich and powerful China got, no matter how unfair the trade practices got, no matter how many millions of our jobs and factories got exported overseas, this has been the bipartisan consensus in Washington. --> ['Slogans']
And Larry, you're right that it started before the Clinton administration and the George W Bush administration definitely accelerated it. --> ['Flag-Waving']
But there has absolutely been a bipartisan consensus in Washington that this sort of unfettered free trade policy was good for the country. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Causal Oversimplification']
Now, how do you change that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Now, look, you can nitpick this and you can make all the process objections you want, but Donald Trump has changed the conversation. --> []
I just want to ask you a round of judgment. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Let me finish. --> []
You keep saying I've offered a process of objection when I'm objecting to the absence of your goal. --> []
Yes, you were pointing to Donald Trump's views when he was a public figure in the 1990s and 1990s on trade, as somehow he was wrong. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
He was not wrong. --> []
He was one of the few people in the few public figures in America who was right about this. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Flag-Waving']
I think most people today would say he was right about this, that throwing open our markets to these foreign policy without taking the consequences of the mistake. --> ['Doubt']
You guys have me completely confused. --> ['Slogans']
Really, you do. --> []
No, I can't use about the increments of your position, Larry. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Larry, you still believe that the Clinton administration, let's call it a bipartisan consensus, that era was correct. --> []
While at the same time you're arguing that PNTR didn't do anything. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I think it is really telling that you are so much more low to defend what we are seeing than to attack what has been. --> ['Flag-Waving']
If you want to, it's fine. --> []
Like I guess you could have, it would be interesting to have you and the same thing. --> []
To me, there's the same thing. --> ['Doubt']
It should have you and Larry go 12 rounds on the Clinton era. --> ['Straw Men']
When I say to you, listen, there is not a stable set of objectives that fit the policy here. --> ['Doubt']
Can I answer that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You say that's a process? --> []
I just want to defend the thing they keep actually doing. --> ['Doubt']
I would like somebody to explain to me here. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Anderson, Chimoff, Chimoff, resilience, central, four sectors. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Are we more resilient in the four sectors? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
What's the answer in two years from now? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I got that. --> []
I agree. --> []
All that. --> []
I cannot make any linkage between a 10% across the board, Tara, a tariff on steel, a tariff on automobiles, and much of what the rest of the president says and your very valid objectives. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I hear David give this. --> []
Free trade has destroyed America and we're going to undo that and they're raided the hard way. --> ['Causal Oversimplification', 'Slogans']
I can give it to you. --> []
I just want to understand how we'll know whether we have to fix it. --> []
Okay, look, I can answer this too. --> []
God, good to me. --> ['Slogans']
All right, look, Larry and Ezra, welcome to a political coalition. --> []
Different people have different objectives. --> []
Just like different people had different objectives for the policy that we had in place 25 years ago. --> []
There are some people who think that we should have an across the board 10% tariff to raise revenue because the country needs revenue and that that would be a better way to raise revenue than to say have income taxes or capital gains taxes. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
Stan Druckenmiller, who's not a fan of tariffs, nonetheless said that he would support a 10% tariff no more than 10, but up to 10 as a way to raise revenue. --> []
Okay, that's his point of view. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
There are other people and I would say I'm more someone who thinks about the geopolitical consequence of this. --> ['Doubt']
Who think it was a huge mistake to throw up in our markets to Chinese products, basically feeding their economy to the point where they could become a peer compared to the United States and threaten the US, the threat in the US world order. --> ['Flag-Waving']
One more time. --> []
There are different people. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Hold on, there's different people with different objectives. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
One more time because you are just not speaking truth. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I'm not saying that. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I want to know one restriction that the United States had on Chinese products that was changed in the year 2000. --> []
You said seven times, throw open our market to Chinese products. --> []
I want to know one example in which the United States opened its market in 1999. --> []
The point of view. --> ['Doubt']
The point of view. --> ['Doubt']
Just one. --> []
The point of view. --> ['Doubt']
Well, that's the point. --> []
Can you name one product? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Yes. --> ['Slogans']
Where restrictions were reduced? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Okay, David Namin. --> []
Listen, you're mischaracterizing what PNTR did. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
We can play this like a GROC game if you want. --> ['Slogans']
People can go ahead and GROC this question and they'll get this answer. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
Look, the answer is that before PNTR, China was granted MFN on a year by year basis by Congress. --> []
Correct? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
PNTR made it permanent. --> []
What does that do? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
It created a permanent new framework for trade relations between the United States and China. --> []
So it created permanence and it created a certain expectation. --> []
What did that enable? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Massive investment by US companies in China. --> ['Slogans']
So all the bean counters from McKinsey started talking about outsourcing and just in time manufacturing. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
They started moving the factories over there in a much greater way. --> []
You know, the Mitt Romney is a private equity. --> []
Exactly. --> []
We just think the Mitt Romney is in private equity. --> []
Said, this is a great idea. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Let's move all of our manufacturing. --> []
Could we make it whether or not it was the WT? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
On the bankers on Wall Street got to financialize and securitize all sorts of new products. --> []
That was the result of PNTR. --> []
The thing we have to decide really right now is a country is if the thing that you all are trying to replace this with is better. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
If it will work. --> []
I want to go back to what you said a minute, David, when you're like, welcome to political coalitions. --> []
Larry has been in politics a long time. --> []
He was Treasury Secretary. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I've covered politics for a long time. --> []
I'm familiar with political coalitions. --> ['Loaded Language']
In fact, a lot of my book is currently about the problems in the way the Democratic coalition with too many objectives all at once can end up destroying the ability of the policy to actually achieve a clear goal. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
This is precisely the non-procedural objection I am bringing here. --> []
This is why I think it is dangerous to be treating an appeal of the entire global financial system without a clearly defined objective that is connected to a policy. --> []
The question is, if the ideas that there are all these different players here who have all these different policy objectives that would connect to all these different policies and everybody is getting a little bit of them and Trump is flipping back and forth through different versions of them, you could end up, despite, yes, whatever mistakes are made in the free trade consensus, which I do agree that we had, you could end up with a bad and not even consensus. --> []
It's just a bad next policy, an unclear coalition that is fighting with itself and is making policy without a strong process can create not like nitpicky procedural problems, but actual damage and disasters. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
Shemoff, let's try to look forward here. --> []
This obviously has been a cataclysmic, chaotic, intense, whatever, a descriptor you want to use of the past week productive. --> ['Slogans']
It's certainly created massive swings in the market. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
Is this all going to cause a recession? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Is this too violent of an approach to markets? --> ['Slogans']
That is, I think, a valid criticism that people have, including the majority of business leaders are saying, hey, I think I have to start layoffs. --> []
You had United Airlines say, we're not going to give any guidance. --> []
This feels to business leaders, Republican business leaders primarily and market participants as just far too chaotic and they can't plan. --> ['Slogans']
If they can't plan, then they stop planning, which then is going to cause layoffs. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
It's going to cause bankruptcies and who knows what the second and third-order consequences are going to be. --> []
What's going to happen here over the next couple of weeks and months? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Just on the recession question, and I'd like to give an answer to Ezra and Larry. --> ['Straw Men']
I think that, and I've said this for about a year, it was clear to me that we were sneakily in a recession before. --> ['Slogans']
The reason was the vast amounts of money and deficits that were being pumped into government services that perverted the actual GDP picture in America. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
As Doge sort of slows down that money flow and as the consensus in Congress gets to a better budget, I think that you're going to see that the government was probably responsible for 100 to 150 basis points of just waste. --> ['Slogans']
If you take that out, you will technically be in a recession. --> []
That was independent of these tariffs. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I think that that's where the true economy Jason was. --> []
I think that we're going to just find that out. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
That's that. --> []
Where we go from here. --> []
I can give you an anecdote and I'll give you a projection. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
The anecdote is this weekend. --> []
My wife and I were in bed and a person called me, a very successful businessman who was representing the president of a country saying, hey, Chimoff, I need some advice. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
What do we do here? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
We walked through the three things that he and his government, that they government, were trying to figure out because they wanted an off-ramp. --> []
They were like, I'm ready to cry, Uncle. --> ['Slogans']
We're ready to tap out. --> ['Slogans']
And again, he was calling me as a private citizen, but I think this conversation was very instructive. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Number one, he's like, look, we have these really high tariffs on inbound American products. --> []
We're happy to cut these things to zero. --> []
And I said, well, you should do that. --> []
Second, while we were exploring, he's like, yeah, you know, we have an enormous capital purchase with Airbus. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
I said, cancel it. --> ['Slogans']
Swap it to Boeing. --> []
He's like, done. --> []
And the third, which was interesting is he's like, we need to import an enormous amount of energy. --> ['Flag-Waving']
And I said, well, who do you give that concession to right now? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And it was a non-American company. --> []
And I said, well, why wouldn't you just RFP that to an American business and let them compete? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Causal Oversimplification']
And he's like, we'd be open to that as well. --> []
So he said, you know, we're getting prepared. --> []
We want to find a way to talk to the Trump administration. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And I'm like, great, however I can be helpful, I'll be helpful to you. --> []
I got off the phone. --> []
I said, if even 30 of these 75 countries do a deal anywhere remotely close to this, this was an enormous win. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
So let me give you my projection, Jason, of what the art of the deal could be here. --> ['Doubt']
What you do is you can rewrite Bretton Woods 2.0. --> []
What was Bretton Woods 1.0? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
It was fixing exchange rates. --> []
It was setting up the IMF. --> []
It was setting up the World Bank. --> []
Those were the conditions on the ground. --> ['Doubt']
Post World War II had made a lot of sense. --> []
What would we do if we had to write the Mar-a-Lago Accords right now? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I think what we would do is work backwards from the question that Ezra asked and the answer that I gave. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
How do we create resiliency in these critical markets? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Number one, a framework for that. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Number two is how do we create limits for government-sponsored intervention against capital for-profit companies, many of whom are American, so that we can actually compete on a level playing field. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
And then number three, very simply, if you can do business in my country, why can't I not do business in yours? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Causal Oversimplification']
And I'll just give you that story for one second. --> []
I was responsible. --> ['Doubt']
I was the head of every single entity of Facebook outside of the United States. --> ['Flag-Waving']
I opened every market. --> ['Flag-Waving']
My team and I created a framework for dominating. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I figured we figured out how to crack Brazil, India, Russia. --> []
You know, the one market that we never could ever make a single Iota progress? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Say it, Jason, with me. --> []
Well, China. --> []
China. --> []
China. --> []
Russia. --> []
No, Iran. --> ['Slogans']
We want in Russia. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
So my point is, in every single market except one, is it that we were just lucky in 174 markets and one we were stupid? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
No. --> ['Slogans']
So I think that the Mar-a-Lago Accords, this sort of Bretton Woods 2.0, is the outcome Ezra. --> []
It will basically use tariffs as a way to get these governments to a table and allow us to negotiate a much fairer economic quid broker. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Here's my concern with this theory. --> []
I want to leave out the sort of question of what the real economy looked like to Larry. --> []
This world in which what is happening is a business leader who represents a country is calling you and saying, okay, what do we need to do to deal? --> []
Right? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
They're coming to Donald Trump and they are going to come to Donald Trump. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
As Larry said earlier, there's no doubt that the U.S. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
economic leverage is enormous. --> ['Slogans']
And virtually every country faced with our might is going to try to cut a deal with us. --> ['Flag-Waving']
But then there's a call they're not making to you that they're making to someone else, which is we have allowed or we have approached the U.S. --> ['Doubt']
as a functionally benign partner for a very long time. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
And now they're becoming a dangerous partner. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
They are very, very strong and they will use that strength to crush country smaller than them when it suits the whims of a personless regime run by a person who his feelings even about people that the U.S. --> []
or countries of the U.S. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
traditionally considered allies like Canada or much of Europe change. --> []
And so yes, on the one hand for the next year or two, we want to avoid getting a big tear of slap on us. --> ['Slogans']
And so we got to figure out what is it that if we offer to Donald Trump, he will say to himself. --> []
That was enough of a give that I can move on to someone else. --> []
I can make them the focus of my eye. --> []
And on the other hand, they're going to begin to build fortresses and deals and partnerships and approaches that make sure they're less exposed to our ability to wield this power against them in the future. --> []
But before I came on the show, I had gone on X and I saw a clip of you going around when you're saying that one of the problems with the Biden administration was that you couldn't get anybody on the phone. --> []
And in the Trump administration, you make the call, the deputy chief of staff picks up. --> ['Straw Men']
You say, Hey, I need you to talk to this company. --> []
They work with them. --> []
They're freaking out about the tariffs. --> ['Slogans']
The deputy chief of stock, Kelsey company, they work something out. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
No, no, not that they work something out. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
They listen. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
They listen. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
This, this world in which we are doing the dealmaking by individual relationships, by who can get their calls answered, not by rules. --> []
It feel clear. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
That's how the, that's how the Biden administration, that's not what I said. --> ['Doubt']
That's not what I said. --> []
Well, Chema, no, as you're trying to make it sound like corruption, hold on. --> []
I was George Clooney. --> []
I was George Clooney that was making a call. --> []
Who cares what George Clooney thinks? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Maybe you just say on why I was very, very critical by the guy. --> []
I saw that clip. --> []
As Roy, what Chema said, what Chema said is simply that the White House listens. --> ['Loaded Language']
They listen. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Whereas he can get his calls returned by the Obama administration. --> []
Great. --> ['Slogans']
I think we're actually not saying something all that. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You may sound like corruption. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Well, I was to help a company. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
What Trump is working through is deal by deal patronage based on how he sees the company. --> ['Doubt']
I'm sorry, the other country. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
That's not what happened. --> ['Doubt', 'Appeal to fear-prejudice']
As Roy, can I just make sure that this is clear to you? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
This is a 150 year old American business. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
I have no interest in that company except a friendship. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
These are Americans hiring Americans trying to compete with China who were very negatively affected. --> ['Causal Oversimplification', 'Slogans']
And all I said was, why don't you have a chance to explain what's happening on the ground? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
My point that I was trying to make and maybe I didn't make it clear enough. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
So let me set the record straight. --> []
The Trump administration, what I have seen as a businessman, is willing to hear the conditions on the ground as a businessman when I was building Ezra just to be clear, critical rare earth supplies for America under the Biden administration, battery can materials to compete with China under the Biden administration, AI chips to be the best in front solution under the Biden administration. --> ['Flag-Waving']
I couldn't get a call back. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
That's just the facts. --> ['Doubt']
Not because I wanted anything, just to tell them what was going on. --> ['Doubt']
So fair enough. --> []
Fair enough. --> []
Okay, fair enough. --> ['Slogans']
I am not telling you that the Biden administration should have returned your calls. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
What I am saying is that the degree to which Trump first and then everybody around him as an example of him because culture comes from the top is working off this kind of individual call and deal making worries me because I believe that you had every one of these calls you're saying and they went exactly the way you say they went. --> []
And then the calls that you are not getting and they are saying that a 10% across the board tariff was too broad and we need to go industry by industry. --> []
And now you're saying that it's going to be too particular and he shouldn't do country by country negotiations. --> []
So we're dealing with the people listening to people. --> []
I am saying people is not deal making as right. --> []
It's just listening to people are you really going to be there and tell me the way Trump himself works is not individual deal making here. --> []
Here's what I've seen with David. --> ['Straw Men']
David is this really is this really the argument here. --> ['Doubt']
I will tell you what I've seen and David seen much more. --> []
What I have seen from the president is he takes in hundreds of opinions and starts to figure out what the ground truth is. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And the reason is when you only listen to one or two every president probably deals with this. --> ['Doubt']
You have this information asymmetry problem because you are the president of the United States. --> []
And so how do you cut through it? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You talk to hundreds and hundreds of people and you try and calculate what the truth is. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
So it's not like he's giving any favor. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
He's collecting information. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
That is a good process. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
You want the most powerful person in the world to get to the ground truth. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Go ahead, Lauren. --> []
I am all for information gathering. --> ['Doubt']
I agree that the Biden administration did not do as good a job as it could have of maintaining relations with the business community. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Flag-Waving']
I agree that it's a good idea for there to be quite extensive connection. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I am also appalled by the half dozen phone calls I have gotten from prominent people in business who have said I'm used to being shaken down when I try to do business in some parts of the world. --> ['Slogans']
It's a new experience to be shaken down by representatives of the president of the United States. --> []
What's the shape when you have close connections? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You help us. --> []
You contribute this way. --> []
That makes no sense at all. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Makes no sense. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
What the president has been trying to do is encourage the president. --> []
It's like investment. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Maybe it is an erroneous perception to which I have been exposed repeatedly. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
But it is a pervasive total nonsense. --> ['Slogans']
You guys are very confident that you're at a perception. --> []
Everybody else's aren't. --> ['Doubt']
It is a perception that is shared by almost everyone who has experience in the conflict of interest area who has looked at the situation of Trump administration officials and those working as special government employees in the Trump administration. --> []
What are you saying? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I just went through that whole process, Larry. --> []
What does that mean? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
It may all be false. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
But I can speak to this because I just went through this process. --> []
It took forever. --> ['Flag-Waving']
It took like months. --> ['Slogans']
I went through the same process everyone else goes through. --> []
The OGE career staff have to go through all of your disclosures and they figure out what the conflicts are. --> ['Loaded Language', 'Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Then you have to divest them. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
It's the same process that everyone goes through. --> []
You're all over the place making all sorts of accusations here. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
If you have some proof or you want to accuse someone, then why don't you just do it. --> []
Otherwise what you're saying is just not true. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
It's not backed up by anything. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
What shook down Eric Adams? --> ['Slogans']
That's a direct accusation that happened in public. --> ['Doubt', 'Appeal to fear-prejudice']
They shook down Eric Adams because they put him in this pocket. --> []
I don't know. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
They're doing business here. --> []
You guys are all over the map making wild accusations. --> ['Slogans']
What maybe? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
There have been a lot of seconds to see the resignations because of their discomfort with being overruled by your colleagues in the Trump administration. --> []
So the suggestion that you have been held to the same ethical standards that I was held and that other members of previous administrations, including the Bush administration, were held, unfortunately is not right. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Well, that's false. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
All right. --> []
Well, there's two issues here. --> []
You may not be familiar with the situation, but I had to divest. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Hold on. --> ['Slogans']
I had to divest a lot as I talked about in this show. --> []
Yes, very weird. --> ['Slogans']
Any event, you guys are all over the map making wild accusations. --> ['Slogans']
Two seconds ago, the shakedown was at the level of companies. --> []
Then all of a sudden it was OG and ethics. --> []
Then it was something about Eric Adams. --> []
You guys are doing business. --> []
Nobody's making it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I like that you're like, who's Eric Adams? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
We're not making it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
No, I know Eric Adams says I supported him on this show. --> []
It's a straightforward way that Trump does business at every level at which he operates. --> ['Doubt']
So it is happening at the level of personal administration. --> []
I know you don't want to hear it. --> []
It's not that I don't want to hear it. --> ['Doubt']
You know how this started? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I'm not sure if he quoted it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
All of a second, Ezra, you misquoted something, Chimasa and another podcast where all he said was that I can get my phone calls returned by this White House where I couldn't with Obama or Biden, even though I was a big donor. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Hold on. --> ['Slogans']
And you guys have somehow morphed that into some sort of like broad ranging accusations of corruption, something like that. --> []
I think I know every is no part of it. --> ['Flag-Waving']
About what the accusation of what your Donald Trump works is. --> ['Doubt', 'Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Ezra, your accusation of me tried to infer some form of corruption or some form of deal-making. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
None of that happened. --> ['Flag-Waving']
What I, again, I'll tell you. --> []
I connected the White House so they could hear on the ground what's happening from a company who was very negatively impacted by the tariffs so that they had the complexion of that feedback as well. --> []
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Do you deny the possibility that your experience with the Trump administration might be different than people who they feel are less allied to them than you are? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Ezra, I'm willing to. --> []
It's a straightforward question. --> ['Doubt']
What are you sure that you're a good sample? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I don't even know what we're talking about anymore. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I think what we're talking about right now is that people who donate to politicians have unique access to politicians. --> []
I think we can all agree that that's the case. --> ['Loaded Language']
That's not true. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Just to be very clear, I have given way more to the Democrats than I've given to Donald Trump. --> ['Flag-Waving']
And you were disappointed about that. --> []
And you said you think about your donations. --> []
And by the way, where you're allied now. --> []
And by the way, like what's crazy is I was the same intellectual person I was under Biden that I am under Trump. --> ['Slogans']
It's just that it seems like the Trump administration is like, well, this is a smart guy with some opinions that we listen. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
By the way, and Larry, you know this. --> []
These are some very close friends of ours that we share mutually that would not even return my calls. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
So it is a little personal for me as well as right. --> []
Just to be honest with you, I'm not going to go there. --> ['Doubt']
But the point is, that's fair. --> []
I have never, I have never seen a single Iota of any form of anything other than just gathering information from the Trump. --> ['Flag-Waving']
And they've never asked me for anything. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Reductio ad Hitlerum']
They've never tried to direct me to do anything. --> []
They just want to know what's going on. --> ['Doubt']
When you ask them, hey, can you talk to such and such a person? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I'm sure you that your experience is not the experience of quite a number of the nation's major law firms. --> ['Flag-Waving']
It is not the experience of quite a number of the nation's business leaders. --> ['Flag-Waving']
It is not the experience of quite a number of the nation's universities that I am neither the first nor the hundredth person referencing efforts at extortion to use the movie The Godfather as a metaphor for the four aspects of the way in which our country is being governed. --> []
What a surprise. --> ['Slogans']
Democratic universities and democratic law firms are making accusations. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
All right. --> []
Let's move on. --> []
We think we've read the tariff issue. --> []
I think we can all agree that if you donate money, you might have better access to politicians. --> []
I want to talk about the future. --> []
If Jason, if you give 10% to the big guy, then you really get access. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
We could do these allegations all day long. --> []
If you, you know, yeah, there's a long list of people who've made donations and there's a long list of favorable things that have happened to them after across all administrations. --> []
And we can debate cause and correlation all day long here. --> ['Loaded Language']
But I wanted to talk about the future of the Democratic Party while we're here, Ezra, you have been on a tour talking about exactly how incompetent, how terrible of the campaign they ran. --> ['Slogans']
What is the future and let Larry get his two cents in here as well? --> []
Is there any saving this party? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And if so, what would it look like? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Well, the problem of the party in the campaign, let me bracket that cause my book of abundance is more about how Democrats govern at both the state and local and federal level. --> []
And some of the pathologies of governance there, then make it hard for liberals to achieve their goals. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
There are versions of this on the right, but I'm not really writing about that in this. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
So my book about its Derek Thompson is about the tendency Democrats have to subsidize things where they are choking off the supply of the thing they want people to have more of. --> []
So think about housing in California, get rental vouchers from the federal government, but we make it incredibly hard to build homes. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
We have a lot of money in energy, which a lot of the Biden administration's policies were about putting huge subsidies behind the building of more clean energy, but they didn't really do anything to make the permitting, the citing, the state capacity to do all of that, capable of building that amount of clean energy at the pace they foresaw us building it, right, that they wanted us to build it. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And behind this, and I can sort of go into a lot of detail here, but it's a diminishment of state capacity that comes from wrapping the state itself in red tape and regulation. --> ['Slogans']
I think we think and have an intuitive way of thinking about the idea of deregulation on the private sector, right, when the government is imposing regulations on private companies, and it's making it hard for those companies to act to do business, et cetera. --> []
But this happens first and foremost on the government itself. --> ['Slogans']
One of my favorite examples I've been using lately, there's a new RAM report that looks at how much it costs to construct a square foot of housing in California, in Texas, in Colorado. --> []
And it does it on two kinds of housing market rate, and it does it on affordable housing, subsidized by the public sector. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And the cost of creating housing in California market rate is 2X in California, what it is in Texas. --> []
But when you get into that public, these subsidized housing where you have all these new standards and rules and regulations being triggered by the addition of public money, it goes up to about 4.4x. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And so you have this real problem, I think, in a way of governing that evolved in the 70s, the 80s, there's a kind of small government version of the Democratic Party, the new left more individualistic, that was worried about too much exercise of government power. --> ['Doubt']
And now that we are in a different world with different problems, we're thinking about reindustrializing, we have a housing shortage, and you have things like the Biden administration, which really are thinking about how to build a lot more in America. --> []
That you don't have either a policy architecture, or I would say a governing culture that makes that possible. --> []
Yeah. --> ['Slogans']
And so a lot of this came from Francis Fukuyama, I think, and Votocracy. --> []
Votocracy, how do you pronounce this? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Fukuyama is a great sort of related concept of etocracy, which is the... V-tocracy. --> []
But you also got another great concept since we're bringing up Fukuyama, which is that neo-liberals, which you've sort of been talking about here with the WTN other things, he says, people think about it as the veneration of the market. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
But it is first and foremost, is the degradation of the state. --> ['Slogans']
And I think that explains a lot more about the world we're in than people recognize. --> ['Flag-Waving']
As you can agree with this, Francis Fukuyama is probably one of the most polarizing modern academics in America. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
As you read, and people end up in their very pro-Fukuyama, or they think Fukuyama doesn't say. --> []
Yeah, I mean, look, because what happened is, I mean, just to uplevel this for a second, is that you had Fukuyama write the end of history, which basically said that democratic capitalism is the end. --> []
I'll be all, and we're basically down to one system, and the whole world's going to run on that system. --> []
And that philosophy then animated, I would say, a neo-liberal and neo-conservative consensus in Washington for 25 years. --> []
And there were three key pillars of that, let's call it globalist consensus. --> []
Number one, we'd have open borders, free flow of labor. --> []
In fact, the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which is considered to be conservative, actually supported a constitutional amendment, saying that we'd have open borders. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
Number two, we'd have open flows of trade and capital, so basically the unfettered free trade agenda. --> []
And then number three, the third leg of it was Pax Americana. --> []
We deploy American troops all over the world to defend this consensus because they've agreed it as liberators, not occupiers. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
I think all three pillars have been refuted. --> []
And the person who has represented the shift in this consensus to, I'd say, a new agenda of economic nationalism and geopolitical nationalism is Donald Trump. --> []
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I was going to guess that. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Listen, when you have, this is a real organizing consensus. --> []
So this is a real organizing consensus. --> []
End of history and the last man is a much more complicated one. --> []
Let me finish the point here, because I'm kind of on a roll here. --> ['Slogans']
Yeah, keep wrapping around. --> ['Slogans']
Bring it home. --> ['Red Herring']
But you have a bipartisan consensus that included both Bush Republicans and Clinton Democrats around these three pillars of globalism. --> []
And then I'd say that country turns against that. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
That's not going to be a smooth process. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
That is going to be potentially a violent process. --> ['Slogans']
It's going to be a disruptive process. --> []
And you guys will raise like all these nippy objections and proster whatever, Donald Trump is bringing that realignment. --> ['Slogans']
But the real question is, was that consensus correct? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Was it a failure? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I would argue as a failure. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Larry, let me ask you a question. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Then when you see something like Doge happening and people start taking a bit of a more unilateral, a quicker, a less veto based approach, is that encouraging to you, Larry, do you think that's the right way to do it? --> []
Because we haven't been able to get the government's smaller sense Clinton. --> ['Doubt']
So are you pro Doge, not Doge, and do you think this sort of objection to, hey, we're going too fast, too violently? --> ['Slogans']
Maybe that's what we need to do at times. --> []
And then I'll go back to you as a response to the same question. --> []
I think Ezra is broadly right about the promiscuous distribution of the veto power. --> ['Slogans']
He's broadly right that we need to be able to do more things more quickly in the state if we're to be an effective government. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
I think we need much more reform. --> []
I think Democrats have allowed themselves excessively to become hostage to particular groups, particular traditional concerns and have lost touch in important ways with an American mainstream. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
And I think that in so far as the election outcomes in recent years have not been what they want, that is an important contribution to how that has happened. --> ['Doubt']
And I agree with David that Donald Trump represents the transformative and profoundly different ideology that has been present in governing America before. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
I do believe that it is fundamentally not new under the sun, just new in America, that it is the one-coron approach, which is very familiar to students of Latin American history in particular. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
And that the general experience of that approach is that its leaders, particularly when they have galvanizing personalities, can be very popular for a substantial period of time, but that they are very rarely remembered well by historians of their countries. --> ['Slogans']
And so my best judgment is that this project is going to end in disastrous failure, despite having put its finger on some important concerns and issues. --> ['Slogans']
Of course, there should be much more aggressive reform of the government than there is, but that does not excuse or mean that it is likely to work out well for some of the mindless savagery that the dose is bringing to traditional American institutions is going to work out well. --> ['Slogans']
And to take just one example, my belief is that the revenue loss from the doses destruction of significant part of the functioning of our nation's tax collection system is likely to exceed in terms of contributing more to the deficit than any savings that is successfully realized. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
What do you mean by that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
What is identified the right thing, but they are executing on it too much. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Go ahead, Sharma. --> []
No, no, I have two questions. --> ['Slogans']
Larry, just tactically, what do you mean by the destruction of the revenue collecting mechanism? --> ['Slogans']
That's question number one, which was just, I just want to understand what you meant. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
But second question, which is more broadly, if Larry, if you were president for a day, just give us the Larry Summers plan. --> []
Like what is the counterfactual to what's happening now? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You can include tariff. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
You can include dose. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
I just want to understand how you would frame the solution to what ails us. --> []
So maybe tactically, just talk about the collections part because you referenced it and then just more strategically, what the Larry Summers 2.0 plan is. --> []
We are firing on mass, people whose job it is to audit people like you. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And the results of that is that we are losing revenue directly. --> []
We are losing revenue further because people once audited go straight in subsequent years. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And we are losing revenue because more and more people are playing the audit lottery, engaging in problematic practices in the expectation that they will not be caught. --> ['Slogans']
Let me tell you my experience. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I get audited every year automatically. --> ['Loaded Language']
And the reason you get audited every single year is typically the way that you acquire your wealth creates complexity, 700, 800, 900 page tax filings. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Now you don't do that yourself. --> []
What happens is you typically pay a large big fore accounting firm millions of dollars to do it. --> []
Deloitte, PWC, Anderson, etc. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Every year that I have been audited, the biggest delta has been about a thousand bucks. --> ['Flag-Waving']
In this case, I actually was owed a thousand by the US government last year, which was spending on. --> []
Incredible. --> ['Slogans']
I will spend it everywhere. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Reductio ad Hitlerum']
So Larry, just so you know. --> []
Well aware of everything you just said and I have no doubt about your personal integrity. --> ['Loaded Language']
It's not the high point you think it is. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Less than a quarter of people with incomes over $10 million are audited. --> []
So lucky. --> []
It's just not true. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Let me ask you everybody is not true that everybody is that everybody is audited. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I get the sense, Larry, you're you like doge, but you don't like the execution. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Got it. --> ['Slogans']
Ezra, you talk about your book. --> []
We got to move faster. --> []
We got to do things faster. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
We got to take more risk. --> []
So are you pro doge or not? --> []
And if you look at the democratic, if you look at this administration, I'm going to call it Trump 2.0 for clarity, these are, I would say two out of three people who are on Trump, whether it's Shamakh, Yorohgan, Besant, Howard, even Trump himself, are Clinton Democrats. --> []
So it's basically Clinton. --> ['Doubt']
Clinton is going to say yourself. --> []
I don't matter. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Ezra, are you happy about doge? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Your book seems to be a plan to do doge like things. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
I think building stake capacity is two dimensions. --> []
One is what the stake can do and the second is rules under which it doesn't. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
Doge seems to me to be fundamentally destructive of state capacity. --> ['Slogans']
First, and this goes again to my endless frustration that I feel like goals are not clearly laid out in the Trump administration. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
What are the measures we are looking at and how will they achieve them? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Is it just trying to cut? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Save a trillion dollars. --> ['Flag-Waving']
They've been very, but that's not efficiency, right? --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I could save a trillion dollars. --> ['Flag-Waving']
No. --> ['Slogans']
I could save a trillion dollars in ways that will make the, let's put it this way. --> ['Flag-Waving']
What Larry was just saying, right? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
If you cut everybody at the IRS, right, just cut every single one of them on the, the doge measure of how much did you save in headcount? --> []
That will look like it counted up towards your save a trillion dollars goal. --> ['Flag-Waving']
But in terms of what Larry is saying, which is the long term efficiency of US tax collections, you would have just made the IRS much, much, much less efficient. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Yeah, no, we get that, but they've also cut all these efficiency software and consulting nonsense. --> ['Slogans']
There is a lot of stuff. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
There is a lot of stuff. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I am not going to tell you that there are zero doge cuts that made sense. --> []
But I am going to say that what I see them doing overall is highly destructive state capacity or similarly, a lot of things happening around USAID and say, PEPFAR funding. --> ['Slogans']
Is PEPFAR efficient? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I mean, yes, you save money by not giving HIV and URTRA viral to children in Africa. --> []
But I think it is good that you do that, right? --> []
So that's not the kind of efficiency I'm looking for. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I am interested in state capacity that is connected to achieving specific goals. --> []
I've talked to a bunch of the people around Doge. --> []
And again, here you get a lot of different ideas of what the goals are. --> []
Some people say, well, what we're trying to do is save money. --> []
But if what you wanted to do is save money, you could say, go to Congress and do a very big bill. --> []
There is a lot of interest in Congress, people like Rokana, who wanted to work with Doge to identify big spending cuts that both sides could agree on, defense being a big piece of this. --> []
And then they decided not to do it. --> ['Doubt']
So Doge, to me, it would be great if somebody tried it. --> []
But I see this is much more of a destruction of state capacity and a hack and slash operation. --> ['Slogans']
Sorry, Summers, we're going to thank you for coming. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I know you've got to drop off right now. --> []
Thank you. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
What about Larry Summers to point out, could be a opportunity? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Do you want to do your Larry Summers? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Yes, yes. --> ['Slogans']
Before you leave, just call out the counterfactuals. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Yeah. --> ['Slogans']
What's your plan, Larry? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Counterfactual is focus on necessary strategic investments in infrastructure, in making America, the leading country unambiguously in the world in technology, particularly disseminating in large-scale artificial intelligence for collective benefit, building a larger network of alliances so that we are in a position to counter China, both with hard power in the form of increased military expenditures and with moral strength and the world as a whole behind us as a central organizing theme of foreign policy and reinvent our education system at every level to pick up on Ezra's notion of being about results and doing all of that while you're doing the abundance agenda as well of frames stuff up so that we're in a position for governments to get things done. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
I believe the country is best governed from the center, not best governs from a radical fringe and I believe moving to a transactional model of leadership is the approach of Latin American strongmen and history does not find it to be a successful model and so I would venerate rather than denigrate the rule of law as part of governing the country. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
All right, they have folks, Larry Summers. --> []
Appreciate you coming on the pod. --> []
Thank you Larry. --> []
Spicy spicy episode here. --> ['Slogans']
Sax, you wanted agents to respond on the doge issue as we wrap. --> []
Wow. --> ['Slogans']
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm pretty productive episode. --> []
Let me partially agree with Ezra here. --> []
I mean, I think that he's trying to introduce this idea of an abundance agenda to the Democratic Party. --> []
I think that's a good thing, you know, I know you've talked about permitting reform and not tying up projects and so many hoops and so much environmental regulation and you know, even DEI and all this kind of stuff. --> ['Slogans']
So I think that is all well and good. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I mean, we should we should do those things. --> []
The thing that I take issue with is that you're on the one hand saying that there's way too much process around just getting things done, right, when you're talking about public works. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
But the objection you're making to Elon is that he's not following enough process. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You know, it's not enough niceties. --> []
Larry called it mindless savagery. --> ['Slogans']
This is the problem is how do you expect anything to ever get done? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
The reason why your public works projects don't happen is because there's too many special interests who get organized and they stop it. --> ['Doubt']
Okay, what Elon is trying to do, we have a $2 trillion annual deficit. --> []
He's trying to figure out how to cut it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Every single program that gets cut, the interests who receive that money and we found out that it's hopelessly corrupt. --> ['Flag-Waving']
You know, Stacey Abrams gets $2 billion for a nonprofit and you have all these NGOs who are basically cashing in. --> ['Slogans']
They're all going to do everything in their power to stop those cuts from happening. --> ['Flag-Waving']
And they're the ones who are ginning up this hysteria, you know, burning down card dealerships and so forth and so on. --> ['Slogans']
So this is the problem that I see is that you don't really have a kind of way to say for the people are actually getting things done. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
That's actually our performing things. --> []
Elon is one who's actually making a difference. --> []
Yeah, can you find any good in this? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I mean, you sound like you're cherry picking you when I brought it up and the question you like, do you support those? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
Your first thing is to say like, well, here's my favorite pet projects. --> ['Slogans']
I want to keep this. --> []
But yes, right? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Like, this is I think really important and weirdly, it's the throughline of almost everything I've said on the show today. --> ['Slogans']
Knowing what you are trying to achieve is the first part of achieving it. --> ['Doubt']
So if Doge is cutting things that I think do good in the world, I'm not going to say, hey, look, they're making the government more efficient. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
We no longer have us, you know, a strong foreign aid program or whatever it might be. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
They've destroyed the Department of Education without knowing what they're cutting there. --> ['Doubt']
I don't think Doge is doing a good job because I don't think they have any in a thoughtful way connected means and ends. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And weirdly, my critique often of Democrats is also that they have not been outcomes focused. --> ['Slogans']
They've been process focused. --> []
So David's point here is actually not been the critique I've made here. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I would make procedural criticisms of Doge. --> ['Loaded Language']
But there's a world in which my hate on Doge is, look, I agree with what they are trying to do, but I wish they would follow the law. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
But that's not my take on. --> ['Doubt']
If you had to pick Kamala Harris continuing the spending that was going on or Elon and Doge cutting, which would you choose? --> []
I would absolutely prefer to Kamala Harris administration to the Trump administration. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
Would I like to see Democrats be significantly more reformist? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Yes, I've written a book about it. --> []
I'm trying to persuade them of this argument. --> []
Your book is about getting rid of this red tape and you just said you want to keep the people who put us in the hallway. --> ['Slogans']
Hold on. --> ['Slogans']
You just, yeah, you say you want to change. --> []
This is radical change. --> []
I agree. --> []
But you just said, you would rather have had the person and the administration that put nine trillion on top of the gap. --> ['Doubt']
Hold on. --> ['Slogans']
Hold on. --> ['Slogans']
Hold on. --> ['Slogans']
I'll never get that change as you guys all invited me here. --> ['Flag-Waving']
You'll never get the abundance agenda that you want. --> ['Flag-Waving']
I don't think it's people like Elon or Trump who get things done. --> ['Doubt']
This is the way that politics work. --> ['Doubt']
You have to have a paradigm shift to get what you want. --> ['Doubt']
I think getting dumb things done is not good change, right? --> []
I actually don't understand how this point is so hard to grok. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
If you get a lot of change and the change is bad, I am going to think that is bad, not good. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
I would hope that is true for all of you that if Kamala Harris or some other Democrat came in and began wrecking things that you wouldn't say, well, we needed a bunch of change. --> ['Slogans']
Let's break everything in sight. --> ['Slogans']
I want to see things done well. --> []
There should be good permitting reform. --> []
I think so. --> []
Let me give you an example of the kind of thing that I am looking for. --> []
We talked about ships a bunch on this show. --> []
I like the chips act. --> []
I did a big piece that coined the term everything, big oliberalism about the way in which the ideas inside that act when they began building up the grant program, layered on too many standards and programs and so on. --> ['Slogans']
But one thing they then did was they passed a bill or by an assigned a bill by Ted Cruz and Mark Kelly taking ships out of the normal environmental review because they said, look, if this is a matter of national security and we are trying to build a semiconductor fab so quickly, we cannot have this layered in years of environmental review which now take on average three and a half to four and a half years. --> []
So because I care a lot about clean energy, one of my arguments is that we should have a speed run for clean energy. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
It should knock through the normal levels of review. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
What is happening in California high-speed rail where it had 12 years of environmental review was not in my view a good idea. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
At the same time, that doesn't force me to say, well, I think we should build a bunch of coal plants with that environmental review because I can make distinctions between things I want to see happen in the world and things I don't. --> []
I think you're totally right with that. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Let me give you the more practical day-to-day example because those are these Albatross projects that are largely a byproduct of ineptitude and corruption. --> ['Slogans']
But let me tell you a more tactical example so that you can understand why what Elon and Trump are doing is so necessary. --> []
So as I told you in 2020, on the back end of COVID, I started a business to build battery, cathode, active material in the United States. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Okay? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
So that's a business we need so that when you want to electrify everything you want to electrify, there are batteries that we can make that's not reliant on the Chinese supply chain. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
It made sense. --> []
The guy that I started it with worked for Elon. --> []
The other guy I started it with was a professor at Stanford and the third guy I started it with was the head of battery engineering at Toyota. --> ['Thought-terminating Cliches']
A more complete group of people I think you couldn't put together. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
So we start to build, we get a deal with general motors so far so good. --> []
But eventually you hit a point where in order to really commercialize, you need some form of government acknowledgement that you're good. --> ['Doubt']
And the way that you do that is you apply to the DOE. --> ['Doubt']
And the DOE has a very legitimate grant program that tries to accelerate these key things, especially things that are critical. --> []
We went through that program, Ezra. --> []
We paid a couple million dollars in consulting fees to the people that we were told to pay it to. --> ['Flag-Waving']
And we were rejected. --> []
Okay fine, kept going, I kept funding the business. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
And then next year, last year, we applied again. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
125 companies applied. --> []
25 were shortlisted. --> []
We all went through incredible diligence. --> ['Flag-Waving']
We won. --> []
Incredible validation. --> ['Slogans']
At the end of that entire process, so really two years from when I started and millions of dollars, we got a hundred million dollar federal grant from the DOE and 50 million dollars from Michigan to build a plant in Michigan to help re-domesticate battery cam in the United States. --> []
It turned out that in that same period while we were going through that rigamarole, Stacey Abrams got two billion dollars after 30 days. --> ['Flag-Waving']
And I just asked the question, what is broken inside of the government that that's possible that hopelessly corrupt. --> ['Slogans']
That's exactly right. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
That's company is 50 people. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
50 people where none of this money goes into our pockets. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
We take that money and we then have to raise more money. --> []
I have to put in more money. --> []
We try to hire people. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
We try to build a battery factory that can basically give us resilience against the Chinese, which I think is great. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
They're an incredibly strong and viable competitor. --> ['Flag-Waving']
In 30 days, she got 20 times more than we did. --> []
How do you explain it? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Here's what I'll say on the two things. --> []
And how do you fix it? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I have not myself looked deeply in the Stacey Abrams story, but I am very skeptical of the counts I keep hearing about it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I suspect that if she had made two billion dollars in 30 days, she wouldn't be now hosting a podcast on crooked media. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
She'd be on an island somewhere. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
So I can't comment on that piece of it. --> []
The broader thing here, though, which is you're getting at, you're frankly, what I worry about is that what you had in that DOE process was fairly quick for the government. --> []
One of the things that I am targeting in the book is the way that even when members of the administration, when governors want things to happen, they are not willing to upend the process, to pass the new bills, to reconstruct the architecture of the federal or the state government to get it happen. --> []
Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom wanted high-speed rail to happen. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Can't you acknowledge? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Can't you acknowledge? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
It's insane that somebody can get two billion dollars after 30 days. --> ['Slogans']
I am not going to acknowledge a story I've not looked into myself because I'm not sure I trust the account of it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I don't think it's crazy. --> ['Slogans']
I don't think it's crazy. --> ['Slogans']
You get the money after 30 days, but it depends on whether or not the process was good. --> ['Doubt']
Hold on. --> ['Slogans']
I want to start before you guys move around to a bunch of like random places. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
The thing that I want to stay on with abundance for a minute here is that the thing that I think would be useful to do is actually build legislation to make these processes work more quickly with more discretion from decision makers and then oversight after the fact, rather than heavy process before the fact. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I was talking to somebody highly involved in the World Broadband programs under Obaidan and one of the things they were saying to me was that there is this entire edifice, as he put it, of policy that is here to make sure I do nothing wrong. --> ['Flag-Waving']
What would be better, and I think this is right, is to allow me to act more and then look afterwards to see if I did something wrong and then hold the accountable for it. --> ['Doubt']
I think too much of our regulation is precautionary as opposed to being able to let people move quickly and make decisions in the real world and then go back and see how they worked out. --> []
I think that is a great point and I agree with you on that. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I think there are a lot of people out there who would say that governments too bureaucratic, there is too much red tape in terms of getting things done, any kind of project like the rural broadband takes 15 steps, three of them were DEI, that is crazy, the environmental reviews and the lawsuits that bog these projects down for years, make them unfinanceable. --> ['Slogans']
There are people who agree with you on that. --> []
You know what they are called? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Republicans. --> []
Republicans agree with this, but you know who doesn't agree with you? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
AOC, An Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. --> ['Flag-Waving']
So maybe you are in the wrong party because I don't think you are going to convince Democrats of this. --> ['Doubt', 'Appeal to fear-prejudice']
But we will see. --> []
Well, I wish you well on that. --> []
I hope you do that. --> []
I appreciate that. --> []
Yeah, no, I do. --> ['Slogans']
I think if you can convince Democrats of this, I think it would be a great thing. --> []
But look, this is my issue with some of what you and Larry are saying is that you want Elon and Trump to abide by all of these procedural niceties. --> []
You want them to play by my mark. --> []
You keep saying this is my view, but it's not my view. --> ['Doubt']
You know who get things done? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
This is what we say in Silicon Valley. --> []
You know who get things done? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Disruptive people, founders, founder mentalities. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
They're the ones who get things done. --> ['Doubt']
Your response, as you're asking me, rapper, I know you have to get getting dumb things done quickly. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
It's not a good idea. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Starlink is a much better idea than rural broadband. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Neither are batteries. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Batteries are not dumb things. --> ['Slogans']
You're asking me about what Trump and Musco doing right now. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
We started here on the tariffs. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
What you're watching with Trump is using expanded terror authorities to do things that have a bad process behind them and we'll have a bad set of outcomes. --> []
So look, I've asked you many, many times here. --> ['Flag-Waving']
I don't really feel like I got the set of metrics I was looking for, but we will maybe talk again in two or three years and we can decide together. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Was this genius work by the disruptors or was this a really, really dumb approach to economic policy? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
What was the issue with the metrics that I gave you, Ezra? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You don't think they could keep? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I don't think they're more. --> ['Flag-Waving']
You want the unit of measurement? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Killograms? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I don't think they're completely complete. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Flag-Waving']
I think you're processing us. --> []
You're doing to us exactly what the government bureaucrats did to rural broadband. --> []
What's your metric? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
How long is it going to take you to deploy this? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
We have to check this. --> []
Yeah, exactly. --> ['Slogans']
Come on. --> ['Slogans']
These are debate. --> []
Here's all you need to know, Ezra. --> []
It's a hundred bucks to get Starlink. --> []
It's 15,000 to do five. --> []
You really spent principles and you're trying to bog it down in procedural arguments. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Hold on, this is amazing to me. --> ['Slogans']
You really think saying to you in two years, what are three or four metrics that we can't do? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
We can't wait. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
What you gave me doesn't fit the poll. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I mean, look, we don't need to do this whole thing again. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
But what you gave me doesn't fit the policy. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
It's just reindustrialization. --> ['Slogans', 'Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Hold on. --> ['Slogans']
We said that we want to reindustrialize America in critical industries, especially and reduce our dependence on foreign supply chains that are based in potential adversarial countries. --> ['Causal Oversimplification']
Concrete enough. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Those are things that are sufficient objective because the other thing that I the part of you, the part of it that I did not hear was, okay, where is the economy? --> ['Doubt']
There's got to be some cost. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
You don't want to wait. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
What metric would you want? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I'd like to see like, okay, GDP growth has been X. I will think you want positive GDP growth. --> []
And we want resiliency for those four critical industries amongst others. --> []
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
And it would be nice for the trade deficits to come down and, you know, especially with certain countries. --> []
All right, get back to work then. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
We're all going to get back to work. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
We got the four critical industries. --> []
We got the GDP increase. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And trade deficits, yeah, it's an open debate. --> []
All right, Ezra climbs new book, abundance is out in fine bookstores and Amazon and all kinds of other places you can get it. --> []
And you can hear him on podcasts. --> ['Thought-terminating Cliches']
Incessantly. --> ['Slogans']
When are you going to stop this podcast? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Oh my god. --> ['Slogans']
Oh man. --> ['Slogans']
It's a group industry. --> []
One of the last. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
Absolutely. --> ['Slogans']
All right. --> []
We'll talk to you soon. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Ezra. --> []
Bye, y'all. --> []
Thanks for having me. --> []
Thanks Ezra. --> []
All right. --> []
Thanks, Ezra. --> []
How do you think the debate? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
What I think is a good debate to have and we made progress here. --> []
The paradox of all of this is what they're describing in some ways is what Trump and Elon are doing. --> ['Slogans']
Yes. --> ['Slogans']
But it's a bit too hot. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
So if I were to give a criticism or room for improvement to the current administration, to maybe pull some of these people over, it's basically, or slowing down and explaining what's going on a bit better. --> []
I give the administration, like I give dogeany plus plus. --> []
It's obvious like they're doing the right thing. --> []
I give the communication like a B like just increase the communication and you can see they're doing that. --> []
Antonio went out and talked a bit about doge. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
They did a roundtable and they're updating the website faster. --> []
The more you do that, the less the opposition's mind is going to wander the same thing with the tariffs. --> []
If the tariffs will, if the cent was out there front center every day talking about methodically what their plan was instead of the shock and all, I think people would be able to process it quickly. --> ['Slogans']
Let me just let me just add one thing to that. --> ['Straw Men']
Just one person's opinion. --> ['Doubt']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I like that. --> []
Obviously you can always say that communication should be better, but here's the reality of it. --> ['Doubt']
Take doge, for example. --> ['Exaggeration,Minimization']
You have crazy leftists, fire bombing, Tesla dealerships, painting swastikas on Tesla cars, a costing Tesla drivers. --> ['Slogans']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Creating violence and payoffs and trying to depress Tesla's sales. --> ['Slogans']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
And who's to blame for that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And then what people say is, well somehow Elon's the disruptive figure here. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
You have a crazy left wing that's reacting in crazy ways to sensible things that doge is doing. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
And then what people do is they reinterpret this chaos that's been created by the leftist. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
They put the blame for that on Elon. --> ['Doubt']
I think your explanation there is even more reason to be proactively communicating decisions. --> []
So then that doesn't forgive anybody drawing swastikers on Tesla's. --> ['Slogans']
Obviously they should go to jail. --> []
And if anybody's coordinating it, that should be like a rico case. --> []
We should find out who it is. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling']
Just if we're going to bring these two parties together, which I think we came close to here of like finding some common ground. --> []
I think Shamatha you outlining your four bullets. --> []
And then at the end, as we're saying, well, what's the impact on GDP? --> []
And then you add into that, so what's the input on the trade difference? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
For the first time, you know, these two sides, I think we outlined what should happen? --> []
What should the measure be in two years? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Have we ensured those important industries? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Is GDP robust? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And is the trade deficit more balanced? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
This is the same debate we always had over immigration. --> []
Let's pick a number and work towards a number, right? --> []
And that's where the debate in our country breaks down in my mind, is that we don't pick numbers. --> []
We can agree that we need a ton of innovation. --> []
Segway, Jason, go. --> ['Slogans']
Hey, I saw that you were at the breakthrough prize. --> ['Slogans']
Sorry, I'm on the weekend. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Sorry, I couldn't make it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I had family stuff, but Freeberg was there as well. --> []
And as everybody knows, this is the breakthrough prize. --> ['Flag-Waving']
It's like kind of the Oscars for science. --> []
They had hundreds of guests there. --> []
And about a third of them were scientists, the third were tech founders, and you had a bunch of Hollywood folks there, hosted by James Corden. --> []
And you had Jeff Bezos, you're emailing there as I mentioned, Zach, Vin Diesel, Sergei, and Gwyneth, and Mr. --> []
Beast, lots of excitement there. --> ['Slogans']
And I know David, you were at a secret conference that also I was almost invited to, that you met Gwyneth, Paltero friend of the pop Jason, my Nick, you can show some photos here. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Oh, we do have photos. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I know. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
My wife sent me a letter to read on the air. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
So let me just open this up here. --> []
Open letter. --> []
It's an open letter to Mr. --> []
Beast. --> ['Slogans']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Dear Gwyneth, Paltero. --> []
Oh, geez. --> ['Slogans']
It's open. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
We don't love letter to Gwyneth. --> []
Okay, I'm just going to read this here. --> []
Last night when I met you, I learned in that moment that pharaoh months are not a myth. --> []
They are real and apparently trademarked by you. --> []
You have the kind of femininity that could destabilize the stock market. --> []
I left the encounter slightly dazed, unsure if it was your presence or an as of yet unlisted group. --> ['Slogans']
Okay, wait, let's just stop here. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Let me just man explain what she's trying to say here, guys. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Wait, you see that girl. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Gwyneth, Paltero. --> ['Slogans']
When if Paltero is hot as balls. --> ['Slogans']
Okay, that's the kind of triars saying she crashed the mark. --> ['Slogans']
She has so much aura and Riz. --> []
David, you have to, I mean, I don't know if we have the picture where David met her at the JPM conference, but she is so kind. --> []
She's got high EQ. --> ['Flag-Waving']
I gotta say so cool. --> []
I have to say like I've met a lot of stars. --> ['Flag-Waving']
That's like a star star. --> []
That's a star star where you're just like holy shit. --> ['Slogans']
You're just kind of like a little bit in awe. --> ['Slogans']
Hmm. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice', 'Slogans']
She's oh, she's a star. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
She's a star. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Look at that. --> []
There she is. --> []
Fifth bestie, Gwyneth, Paltero, G-Po. --> []
That was stunned. --> ['Slogans']
That was stunned. --> ['Slogans']
I was stunned. --> ['Slogans']
We were all stunned. --> ['Slogans']
So wait, are you saying that Nat has a girl crush? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I think so. --> []
Girl crush has been declared here for the first time on all in. --> ['Slogans']
We have an official girl crush. --> ['Slogans']
When I think it's just remarkable, Jason, though, is that another conference lost your invitation in the mail. --> ['Flag-Waving']
I mean, it is crazy. --> ['Slogans']
You've got to talk to the post office about all these invites. --> []
I keep getting on. --> ['Slogans', 'Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I'm just sure. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I my White House invite this email man. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
He was eight years ago. --> []
I don't know. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I gotta get invited. --> ['Slogans']
I think that you're a great. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I guess I'll see everybody enough. --> []
What? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You're a great, you're a great family man. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
So at least you're, but you're always busy with your family. --> []
So you, I think people know I try to prioritize the fam. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
I got young girls. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
What am I supposed to do? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
You know, oh my gosh. --> ['Slogans']
Big shout out. --> ['Slogans']
Big shout out to your enjoy of Milner. --> ['Slogans']
I think, yes, incredible. --> ['Slogans']
What they're doing to inspire people to get into science is just so. --> ['Doubt']
You know, they get the awards are enormous. --> ['Slogans']
It's like three million dollar awards, which I think it's just kind of like it's an amazing reflection of how important this stuff is. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans']
And so far the last two years also had a little tear, had a shed a little tear. --> ['Slogans']
Because they do these things where like, you know, you bring some of these folks that had been impacted positively. --> []
There was a girl who had her jeans edited. --> []
She was literally on on her deathbed. --> ['Slogans']
And this guy David Lew, who on the breakthrough prize, did a very targeted gene edit. --> []
She's alive and thriving. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
And she gets to present the award to him. --> []
And you're just like, oh my god. --> ['Slogans']
It's, you know, Saks, when he said he was shedding a tear or almost shed a tear. --> []
I thought he was going to say he saw his reflection in his exito and just got a little chunked up about it because he's how good he looked. --> ['Slogans']
Roth does look good in that photo. --> []
Put it back up. --> []
Put it back up. --> []
Let's see this photo. --> []
You see how much he wears the silhouette. --> []
The silhouette on your tuxedo is just outstanding. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Well, that so net. --> []
So net swearing our money, Prevay. --> []
And I'm wearing Laura Piano, which is like a double bracelet. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
They make a double bracelet. --> []
Wow. --> ['Slogans']
They make a double bracelet. --> []
Wow. --> ['Slogans']
They make that touch. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Yeah. --> ['Slogans']
As a touch. --> []
Yeah. --> ['Slogans']
As a touch. --> []
I cannot comment on the material choice because it was just that is. --> ['Doubt']
Wow. --> ['Slogans']
That's like gorgeous garment. --> ['Slogans']
Well, actually, you know, Friedberg was going to be on the program today. --> []
But then he found out how many endangered species. --> []
Did you guys murder? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Did you see that? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Nick, do you have the picture of us with Zoe Saldana? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Oh, there's us in Friedberg. --> []
Oh, Friedberg's good. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Oh, there's Zoe Saldana, Mr. --> ['Straw Men']
Beast and her husband. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Who's scared of the man bun? --> ['Appeal to Authority']
Marco Perego. --> []
Great guy. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
This is Zoe Saldana's husband. --> []
A cooler, funnier, fun dude. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
You're not going to that guy should be at every party. --> ['Doubt']
Really? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Every man bun. --> ['Flag-Waving', 'Slogans', 'Red Herring']
Yeah, every bun definitely looks like it's carrying. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Okay. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Zoe Saldana's tattoo and her honor chest. --> []
I don't know if that's true. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I want to see if that close guy on X is always critiquing Republicans. --> ['Slogans', 'Appeal to Authority']
Oh, he's awesome. --> ['Slogans', 'Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I love to hear that. --> []
Yeah, dear. --> ['Slogans']
I want to know if he how he responds. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Well, that's terrible. --> ['Slogans']
Mr. --> ['Bandwagon']
Beast fails. --> []
But I want to know how he responds to your Tuxedo Jamoth and finally gives you credit because I think he only compliments Democrats as sort of the problem. --> []
Oh, is he really not? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Yeah. --> ['Slogans']
Yeah. --> ['Slogans']
He's always picking on Republicans. --> []
Jimmy, look at that. --> []
Did you guys see the picture of Julia's dress? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I just want to say one thing about Julia's dress. --> []
Do you see Julia's dress? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I have them. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Let's take a look here. --> []
This is an insane story. --> ['Slogans']
So this is Julia Milner. --> ['Doubt']
So the cool thing about this guy is this is this isn't very incredible and famous painting by Rafael called the School of Athens. --> ['Flag-Waving']
Yes. --> ['Slogans']
This is like a visual manifesto of human knowledge. --> []
And so there's all these very important people Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Pythagorean Pythagoras, etc. --> []
Anyways, she got the license, I think from like the Vatican. --> []
And then she worked with Dolce and Gabbana to make it into a dress for the occasion just to celebrate learning. --> []
But there she is with with our boy Jimmy Donaldson. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
So anyways, it was a great event. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Thank you. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Yuri and Julia for including us. --> []
All right, guys. --> []
I got to wrap. --> []
All right, David. --> []
I miss you. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Thanks for the invite. --> []
All right. --> []
Bye, son. --> ['Red Herring']
I will hand deliver Jason's invitation. --> ['Loaded Language']
I'm pretty sure you can text me the invite. --> []
I could you could send me a calendar. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
I have a G Cal. --> []
I've got a Google calendar. --> []
You could invite. --> []
I'm a good. --> []
Oh my god. --> ['Slogans']
Oh my god. --> ['Slogans']
It's so funny that that event that Saks was at. --> []
One of our mutuals was like, hey guys, this incredible event's going on. --> ['Slogans']
This famous person's hosting it. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
The celebrities are coming. --> []
J. Cal, Freeberg, everybody you're all invited. --> []
And then like two weeks per day, man, I was like, um, are we going to this thing? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Because I'm just like my calendar and everything. --> []
They're like, ah, yeah. --> ['Slogans']
Yeah, the event's happening. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
And I'm like, for you, Jason. --> []
Did you send me event? --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
And they're like, they're like, I'm not sure. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
You're my, I'm like, you're my, I'm not. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
I invite, but you didn't email it. --> ['Appeal to fear-prejudice']
Okay, it's sure. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I will never go to an event that rejects you ever. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Like a writer, die, baby. --> ['Slogans']
For our chairman dictator, another exceptional episode of the All in Podcast. --> ['Appeal to Authority']
We'll see you all. --> []
Love you, baby. --> ['Slogans']
Bye-bye. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Bye-bye. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
Oh, man. --> ['Slogans']
We should all just get a room and just have one big hug. --> []
Because they're all just like this like sexual tension that we just need to release some time. --> ['Doubt']
What you're, that be what you're here for. --> ['Doubt']
Be what you're here for. --> ['Doubt']
We need to get merch. --> ['Name Calling,Labeling', 'Slogans']
I'm doing all in. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
I'm doing all in. --> ['Obfuscation,Intentional Vagueness,Confusion']
Bye-bye. --> ['Reductio ad Hitlerum']
